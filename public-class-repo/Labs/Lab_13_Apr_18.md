# Lab 13: Hwk 5 review and starting Hwk 7 

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Spring 2017*

In this lab your TAs will present solutions to problems from Hwk 5
that you want to see.  This will be done on the whiteboards in
lecture.

If you have questions about the assessment of your Hwk 5, then ask the
TA that graded your work.  They should be in your lab.  If not, ask
another TA, they should also be able to help you.

In this lab you may also begin working on Hwk_07 - the assignment on
modular programming using OCaml modules. You will find the
specifications for Hwk_07 in the usual place.
