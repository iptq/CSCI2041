# Lab 9: Expression evaluation

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Spring 2017*

This lab time is dedicated to solving the lingering issues you
may have with your Hwk 04 assignment.

Use this time to discuss any questions you have with the TAs.  Also
make sure that your code is passing the feedback tests that you expect
it to pass - inspect the ``Hwk_04_Feedback.md`` file that is pushed to
your repository after any updates and push that you do.

If you've completed Hwk 4 you need not attend this lab.
