type 'a stream = Cons of 'a * (unit -> 'a stream)

let rec ones = Cons (1, fun () -> ones)

(* So, where are all the ones?  We do not evaluate "under a lambda", 
   which means that the "ones" on the right hand side is not evaluated. *)

(* Note, "unit" is the only value of the type "()".  This is not too
   much unlike "void" in C.  We use the unit type as the output type
   for functions that perform some action like printing but return no
   meaningful result.

   Here the lambda expressions doesn't use the input unit value,
   we just use this technique to delay evaluation of "ones". 

   Sometimes lambda expressions that take a unit value with the
   intention of delaying evaluation are called "thunks".  *)

   is the product of then "next" natural number and the previous

(* The Sieve of Eratosthenes

   We can compute prime numbers by starting with the sequence of
   natual numbers beginning at 2. 

   We take the first element in the sequence save it as a prime number
   and then cross of all multiples of that number in the rest of the
   sequence.

   Then repeat for the next number in the sequence.

   This process will find all the prime numbers.
